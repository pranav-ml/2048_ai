# 2048_ai
An ai to beat the classic 2048 game!
This is a project which uses the monte carlo algorithm to create an ai which can beat the classic 2048 game.The user can also choose to play the game.Feel free to meddle with the parameters in the constants.py script.Run the main.py script to run the project.

Note: Although the ai can perform much better than most human beings, the game introduces new tiles at random positions and hence there is a chance that the ai might lose.
